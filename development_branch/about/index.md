# Welcome to the NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility (FSF) 
![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Arthurs_Seat.png){: .align-left} 
The NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility is an expanding world class facility supporting Earth System Science. The FSF comprises of a pool of high quality field spectroradiometers with associated calibration and support equipment. 
The facility is based in the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh and is physically housed in the Grant Institute at the Universityâ€™s Kings Buildings site.

## Our Mission Statement
The mission of the Field Spectroscopy Facility is to:
- Support high-quality, peer reviewed NERC science
- Maintain a pool of modern, high quality field instruments and an associated optical instrument calibration and characterisation facility. These are to be made available to environmental scientists in support of their research through a FSF SC peer review process. The field equipment includes spectroradiometers, sun photometers and associated equipment to support their field use and the laboratory instrument include calibration sources, full wavelength and monochromatic light sources and directional response instruments
- Provide training and user support, and to promote good practice in the application of field spectroscopy
- Promote the awareness, application and technology of field spectroscopy and to disseminate to a wider scientific community, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom, the effectiveness of public services and policy and the quality of life
- Undertake research into calibration procedures, measurement methodology, data analysis and display appropriate to the FSF mission and to disseminate the results by the most appropriate means.

## The Team
![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/240_180.png){: .align-left} **Dr Steven Hancock** <br>Facility Director
<br>Steve is a lecturer in 3D environmental data capture. Steve's research concentrates on developing methods to measure vegetation structure with remote sensing instruments and using those measurements to better understand climate, weather and ecological processes. <br>

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/240_180.png){: .align-left} **Mr Jack Gillespie**<br>Operations Manager
<br> Jack joined the FSF in November 2018, and works alongside Robbie to ensure that equipment is in excellent condition, calibrated, and arrives with the user in time and in once peice! Jack is a BSc Geography graduate from the University of Edinburgh, and since graduating has taught Geography field courses in North Wales and Devon, before becoming a surveryor for the E.U. LUCAS 2018 project prior to joining the FSF. <br>

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/240_180.png){: .align-left} **Dr Robbie Ramsay**<br>Earth Observation Equipment Specialist
<br> Robbie conducted his PhD research at the University of Edinburgh, investigating the surface-atmosphere exchange of trace gases and aerosol particles. He operates the in-house optical calibration laboratory, ensuring the calibration, validation and quality assurance of the facility's field and laboratory equipment. <br>

## Our Steering Committee 
The running and development of the Facility is overseen by the FSF Steering Committee. This is a panel of six to eight people comprising the Facility Director, NCEO Divisional Director for EO Instrumentation and Facilities (EOIF), and four to six experts from the UK remote sensing community, whose details are presented below. Among other things the Steering Committee exist to review applications for use of Facility equipment, to monitor output from the Facility (research, reports, software products), and to provide advice to the Director of NERC Services and Facilities on all aspects of the operation of the Facility.
