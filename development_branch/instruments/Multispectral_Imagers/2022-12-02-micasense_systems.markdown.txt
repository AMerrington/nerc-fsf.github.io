## Overview
At FSF we have two MicaSense imagers- the Altum and the RedEdge-M. Both are multispectral cameras, and are fully intergrated on our UAV systems as well as available to be mounted on handheld booms.

## MicaSense Altum
{% include  gallery id = "gallery1"%}
### Where would you use this sensor? **Informal or 'Example applications'**
- Precision agriculture | Vegetation health
- DSMs | Basic detection of soil types
- Biomass mapping | Water stress
- Thermal heat mapping
### Features
Synchronized capture of multispectral, thermal, and highresolution imagery. Calibrated thermal and multispectral outputs. High resolution multispectral images. Integrated GPS, with downwelling light sensor (DLS).
### Center wavelengths **Have link to page with explanation of bands**
Blue 475 nm, Green 560 nm, Red 668 nm, Red edge 717 nm, Near infrared 840 nm, and Thermal 11 Âµm.

## MicaSense RedEdge-M
{% include  gallery id = "gallery2"%}
### Where would you use this sensor? **Informal or 'Example applications'**
- Precision agriculture | Vegetation health
- DSMs | Basic detection of soil types
- Biomass mapping
### Features
RedEdge-M has five bands-blue, green, red, red edge, and near-infrared. It is provided with a downwelling light sensor (DLS).
### Center wavelengths **Have link to page with explanation of bands**
Blue 475 nm, Green 560 nm, Red 668 nm, Red edge 717 nm, Near infrared 840 nm, and Thermal 11 Âµm.

## UAV Systems for our MicaSense imagers
The MicaSense unit and DLS will be supplied fully integrated with a UAV system. This will ensure that each image is accurately time and geostamped for prostprocessing.

These will be supplied with either:

###DJI M100
System information -DJI Website

###DJI M210
