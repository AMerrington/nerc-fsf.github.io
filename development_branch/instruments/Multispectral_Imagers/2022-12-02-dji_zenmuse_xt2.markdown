## Overview
The Zenmuse XT2 from DJI and FLIR, combines DJI's expert gimbal technology and FLIR's industry-leading thermal technology in a dual thermal and visual camera. The XT2 features dual 4K, 12MP, 1/1.7Â° CMOS visual sensor and FLIR Tau 2 radiometrically calibrated thermal sensor. This can also be supplied with logging thermostats to provide thermal ground targets in scene.
